This program uses a button designed in html and css to generate a random number using JS

We use min and max as our limits by setting them as 1 and 6 respectively

Math.floor let's us round our number down to whatever is the lower limit ( Eg: 4.1 will give us 4 and 4.9 will also give us 4)

We update our label by using the .textContent command after we retrived the label from our html file by using document.getElementById('mylabel')
